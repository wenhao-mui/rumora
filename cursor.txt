Create a production-ready Next.js 14 website project (project name: rumora) using the App Router with the following tech stacks

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
* TypeScript for type safety.
* Tailwind CSS for styling with a clean, minimal UI.
* File structure that follows the recommended Next.js conventions (app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, types/).
* Reusable components using shadcn/ui (buttons, cards, modals, navigation, etc.).
* Layout system with a global header, footer, and responsive design.
* SEO best practices (dynamic metadata, Open Graph, canonical URLs, sitemap.xml, robots.txt).
* API routes in app/api for server-side logic.
* Environment variables using .env.local and process.env.
* State management with React hooks (and Context API if needed).
* Performance optimizations: image optimization (next/image), font optimization (next/font), dynamic imports for heavy components.
* Testing setup with Jest + React Testing Library (unit & integration tests).
